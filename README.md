# NameMeaningAI

NameMeaningAI is a project that leverages Angular, Spring Boot, and Python to generate meaningful interpretations for given names using an advanced AI model. The application combines the power of modern web development (Angular), robust backend services (Spring Boot), and the flexibility of Python for AI processing to deliver an intuitive and insightful tool for exploring the meanings behind names. Please note that while the AI model strives for accuracy, the results may not always be precise. However, i aim to provide not only informative but also amusing interpretations, making the exploration of name meanings an enjoyable experience.

## Key Features

- **Angular:** Dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Spring Boot:** Scalable and efficient backend infrastructure.
- **Python:** State-of-the-art AI model for name analysis.
- **MySQL:** Persistent storage for names and generated meanings.
- **AI Model:** Context-aware name meanings using machine learning.

## How It Works

1. Users input a name through the Angular interface.
2. The request is sent to the Spring Boot backend.
3. The Python-based AI model analyzes the name.
4. The generated meaning is stored in a MySQL database.
5. The result is presented to the user through the Angular front-end.
